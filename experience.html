                    <h3>Technical Support Consultant</h3>

                    <p>My role involves using an extensive knowledge of our Product Information Management SaaS solution to help customers make the most of their product data.

                    <h3>1st Line Web Support</h3>
                    <h3>October 2017 - October 2019</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially my primary role was first line phone support for the web team. As the role progressed and I became more confident with web development and hosting I was given my own product, Wordpress Express, a modular Wordpress theme, built in house, designed to give clients an easily accessible introduction to the Wordpress platform. I act as project manager and developer for these website builds. Alongside delivering WPX websites for clients I am also the sole developer of updates and new modules for the theme. This gives me experience following best practice HTML, CSS and PHP. I also regularly use Bitbucket (Git) and Advanced Custom Fields when working with the theme. I have also been working towards an NVQ level 3 as an Infrastructure Technician, for which I am also involved with internal technical support for the company. Technical Support has given me the chance to work a lot more with server configuration, database management (MySQL), Active Directory and Windows mail server.
